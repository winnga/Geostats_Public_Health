
 This data-set lists the monthly number of incident cases of malaria reported
 at Kericho, Kenya, between January 1979 and October 2004. 

 Named columns are:
   Month: calendar month (text)
    Year: calendar year 
   Cases: number of cases

 The data were provided to me by Israel Ukawuba (Columbia Uiversity). Note that a
 complete analysis would require additional information, including population
 denominators
